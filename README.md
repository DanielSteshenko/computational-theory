## Countdown Numbers Game


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on the computational theory behind solving the Countdown numbers game. The content covers:


- Explanation of the game's rules and objectives.
- Analysis of the game's computational complexity.
- Description of the solution strategy used in our solve_numbers function.
- Presentation of function usage examples and the functional programming techniques implemented.

This approach provides a concise understanding of both the theoretical framework and practical application necessary for tackling the numerical challenges of the Countdown game.
